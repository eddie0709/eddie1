    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Eddie Zhang — a student, innovator, athlete, and global thinker. From a young age, I’ve shown an insatiable curiosity for the world around me, diving deep into diverse fields from robotics and economics to classical music and environmental sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the captain of a champion robotics team, a national award-winning basketball center, and a seasoned traveler who has explored four continents. Whether I’m coding an AI project, leading my debate team, mentoring peers, or helping my community, I strive to lead with integrity, creativity, and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently enrolled in a rigorous international leadership program, I maintain top grades while balancing extracurriculars like music (tuba, piano), research internships, entrepreneurship competitions, and international summits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in dreaming big, working smart, and lifting others as I climb. I aim to contribute to a more connected, sustainable world — one invention, idea, and act of kindness at a time.
